# Expo Updates - Intermittent Network Request Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with Expo's update mechanism. The issue involves intermittent failures when checking for app updates, returning a vague error message unrelated to the root cause.  The app, despite having a working network connection, fails to connect to the update server.  Solutions attempted include network setting adjustments, cache clearing, and app reinstallation, all without success.

## Bug Report

The bug is detailed in the `bug.js` file. The primary challenge is the lack of a specific error message. Debugging was difficult due to the generic nature of the error and inconsistent reproduction. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a potential workaround (or fix) for this issue. The solution was not directly related to Expo's update mechanism but rather addressed the issue of inconsistent network configurations that occasionally interfered with the update process.
