While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the expo-updates package.  The error message was vague and unhelpful, stating something like "Network request failed" or a similar generic error. The app would fail to check for updates, even though the network connection was fine.  I checked my network settings, my Expo config, and the console logs, but nothing obvious indicated the problem. I also tried clearing the cache and reinstalling the app, with no success. This issue has been intermittent and hard to reproduce consistently.
